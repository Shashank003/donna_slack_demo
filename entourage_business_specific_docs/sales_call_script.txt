SALES CALL SCRIPT

						




 
AN INTRODUCTION TO SALES CALLS
			
How you position yourself throughout the sales process is critical. We often unconsciously turn people away even before we get a chance to present our product or service. Understanding how to position yourself in a manner that attracts people to you will create a sales process that is both effective and non-salesy.

The best sales conversations flow two-ways. The salesperson is prepared and in control, but this should feel uncalculated to the prospect. The prospect is being taken along a journey where they have the opportunity to learn how your offer/s help alleviate their greatest fears and frustrations, or achieve their biggest dreams and desires. The focus is on getting the prospect to chase you, not convincing the prospect to buy.

Sales conversations vary from business-to-business because of nuances in product/services, industries, and product/service pricing, among other factors. But, the one commonality is, when we sell, we sell to humans, and all humans have similar innate habits when it comes to their decision-making around purchases. The extent to which humans exhibit these habits, and the length of time it takes them to make a decision varies, but our ultimate needs throughout the process are alike. This High-Converting Sales Call Script leans into this fact and provides a framework for creating and delivering a sales call in any scenario - for both warm and cold leads.


 
BUILD YOUR SALES CALL SCRIPT

Your sales script should be made up of the below stages in the order they appear. The length of time you spend at each stage will vary depending on the prospect. Human interaction is not linear so we’d recommend having a script but keeping it flexible. You’ll also want to deeply reflect on your customer habits and needs, product/service type, industry and sales cycle, then tailor the script to suit.
						
Your script consists of 9 steps:

1.	Introduction		 							
2.	Certainty (If It Is a Cold Prospect)
3.	Frame Up
4.	Qualification
5.	Solution
6.	Presenting
7.	Closing (we prefer Starting)
8.	Best Next Steps
9.	Point of Sale Referral
 							
						 					
				
				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 								

 
STEP 1: INTRODUCTION
						
Open Your Communication
							
We are often in a hurry to win people over in the sales process and unintentionally push them away from wanting to buy from us. How you open your communication with your audience is critical to converting more customers.
							
This introduction template allows you to create a natural flowing sales process that will instantly lower buyer’s resistance, engage, build trust and remind your prospect of why you are speaking with them (e.g. where they come into contact with your business).
							
A-Grade Intros will;
							
1.	Consider what the prospect is thinking and how they are feeling, their fears, frustrations, wants and dreams
 								
2.	Aim to get a ‘yes’ as quick as possible to subconsciously lower buyers resistance
 								
3.	Clearly set expectations by letting the prospect know why you’ve called
 								
4.	Include pauses to allow for two-way communication, rather than a ‘talking at’ the prospect approach
 								
5.	Communicate what you do using ‘green braining’ i.e. DON’T just communicate the feature, DON’T just communicate the outcome of the feature, DO communicate what effect the outcome of the feature has on their fears, frustrations, wants and dreams.
							

INTRODUCTION SCRIPT TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUSINESS:
							
“Hi [prospect name], it’s [your name] from [your business]”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
“[prospect name], you recently [registered/downloaded/bought - insert lead source]. Does that ring a bell?”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
“I can see you [insert rapport building fact e.g. live in Townsville, my uncle lives in Townsville! Nice and sunny as usual up there?]”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
“[prospect name], the reason for my call today is that we have been [action that gives credibility e.g. working very closely with our community of XYZ Experts] to understand [Green-Brain ‘why’] to [Red Brain ‘how’], so you can [Green Brain effect that has on frustrations, fears, wants and dreams]. Is it possible that might be helpful for you?”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
						
					
			
 
STEP 2: CERTAINTY
									
Clarify their Knowledge
					
If they are a cold prospect, you need to establish how well they know your business, how they know you, do they know how you help and are they keen to explore more about what you offer.
					
CERTAINTY SCRIPT TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUSINESS:
								
“Is this the first you have heard of [your company] or have you been following us for years? / How well do you know [your company]? / And do you know why [target audience] reach out to us to help solve their [overarching problem you solve]? / And do you know how we help them?
								
Sounds like you know [summarise how much they know], so would it help if I just clarify [Who, why, how; whichever they are unclear of]?”
								
*Pause throughout the questioning sequence and wait for the prospect to engage.*
							
					
 
STEP 3: FRAME UP
						
			
Set Expectations for the Call
					
The Frame-Up sets the expectations in the mind of your potential customer of the nature of the conversation you will have with them over the phone. By outlining and then following a process with your prospect, you’ll set yourself up for a comfortable conversation that will ultimately lead them to make a decision in your favour.
							
In your frame up you need to wrap up the next steps in the process to becoming a customer into no more than 4 key points. Your aim is to:
							
1.	Set expectations for what will happen in this call and what outcomes are possible
 								
2.	Define the way you want them to think about what you will go through in the conversation
 								
3.	Frame the decision you want them to make as both positive and their choice.
 								
							
FRAME UP SCRIPT TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUSINESS:
								
“Let me talk you through what most people do in this process, [Prospect name]. Then we can make a decision at the end what the best next step is for you to move forward. Does that sound good?”
								
*pause and wait for them to engage then highlight the 4 key steps in the process*
							
							
 
STEP 4: QUALIFICATION
					
Is this a ‘Fit’?

Now you’ve built rapport with your prospect, you need to know whether what you do appeals to them.
							
A-Grade Qualifications will;
							
1.	Let prospects know what’s in it for them
 								
2.	Use a 3 pillar strategy to describe what you do, bucketing your offer into 3 key areas to avoid overwhelm
 								
3.	Uncover if this person is the decision-maker, or the sole decision-maker. If they aren’t you’ll want to find a time to talk with all the decision-makers
 								
4.	Aim to get the prospect to articulate their buying motivators. Get your customer to verbalise and recognize their buying motivators to you themselves.
 								
							
QUALIFICATION SCRIPT TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUSINESS:
								
“Let me talk you through how we do what we do, [pillar 1 - key thing you do], [pillar 2 - key thing you do] and [pillar 3 - key thing you do]. This is how we help all our customers/clients. Does that appeal to you in any way?”
								
*pause and wait for them to engage*
								
“What we’ve learnt is that people are looking to [problem], [problem] and [problem], so we’ve done [solved the problem], which achieves [effect of solving the problem].”
													
*repeat for all pillars*
						
[Prospect name], Does that kind of structure appeal to you?”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
“Great, why?”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
“Now we’ve figured out what appeals to you, tell me abit about your journey”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
“So, a lot of people come to us for [reason 1], [reason 2] and [reason 3]. What would be your number one priority?”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
“What are two or three impacts of not having [their priority]?
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
“What’s going on there? Tell me more about it”
						
*pause and wait for them to engage*						
							
“How long has that been going on for you?”						
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
“When do you want to see change by?”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
*If after you’re questions sequence they aren’t a fit, you are allowed to say that but ensure you keep the doors open for the future as people’s circumstances change*
							
E.g. “I think we can help but [the reason why they aren’t a fit] means we may not be the right fit, at this point in time.”
							
“So tell me, in business, are you carrying all this weight on your shoulders. Who else is there to bounce decisions off? Are you doing it all yourself?”
							
*pause and wait for them to engage*
							
*IMPORTANT: Don’t progress further than the qualification step if they aren't the decision-maker or the sole decision-maker.*
						
						
							
 
STEP 5: SOLUTION
				
Provide a Solution
					
Now you’ve qualified the customer and you feel what you are a fit for each other, you want to provide a solution. This solution script formula empowers you to present your product/service in the most compelling way so that price isn’t an issue. You need to convey with certainty that what you have to offer is right for them.
				
SOLUTION SCRIPT TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUSINESS:
								
“[Recap their scenario].”
								
“[Prospect name], is there anything else that I need to know that you have not told me about? Anything else you want to share with me?”
								
*pause and wait for them to engage*
								
“Okay so, based on what you said, [recap what they said - this is the goal, this is where you want to go and this is what’s holding you back]. I think there is a really good link between the 3 pillars we spoke about and where you are now. And I can see a lot of you in the customers we are helping regularly already.”
								
Based on the fact that I think we can help you and we are a good fit, I would love to talk about how we could progress and then at the end I can tailor for you the cost/price/investment. How does that sound?”
								
*pause and wait for them to engage*
								
“[Solution], has [feature] that will achieve [result feature gives them directly] to [feeling e.g. stop worrying about x because you’ll get x.
								
“You can see how that makes a difference, don’t you? [Or alternatively, you can say “Isn’t that what you want?”]”
						
 
STEP 6: PRESENTING
										
Present the Options
							
After you’ve given a solution, you need to present the options. It’s good practice to have three different options. You should present the option that you think would give them the most value as the middle option.
							
Be sure to title your products/services with Green Brain style names.
					
PRESENTING SCRIPT TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUSINESS:
								
“[option 1], [problem it solves], [features], [effect]. [option 2], [problem it solves], [features], [effect]. Most people like this one because [why do people like it]. [option 1], [problem it solves], [features], [effect].”
							
 
STEP 7: CLOSING (AKA STARTING)
							
How Will they Proceed
						
Once you’ve presented the options, you need to ask the customer to select what product/service they want to go ahead with. Don’t provide them with too many options and select the options based on what they had interest in in the previous step.
								
CLOSING (AKA STARTING) SCRIPT TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUSINESS:
								
“Which solution are you leaning towards, option A or option b?”
								
*pause and wait for them to engage*
								
“Why is that?” *with a hint of curiosity.* *pause and wait for them to engage*
								
“I completely agree.”
								
*Elaborate as necessary on why you agree with their choice and their reason for that choice.*
							
				
 
STEP 8: NEXT BEST STEPS
							
Set Expectations for Next Steps

Once the customer has committed to an option, you need to set their expectations for what the next steps are to officially become a customer - from processing the payment to any paperwork and other customer journey steps. You want to limit the next steps to 2-3.

NEXT BEST STEPS SCRIPT TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUSINESS:
								
“Great. So, what we need next is [step 1], [step 2] and [step 3]. How does that sound?”
						
 
STEP 9: POINT OF SALE REFERRAL
										
Fill Your Sales Pipeline
					
As you convert a prospect into a paying customer, you should always try to replace them so you have a constant stream of potential customers in your pipeline. A great way to do this is in a point of sale referral.
						
POINT OF SALE REFERRAL SCRIPT TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR BUSINESS:
								
“Now that we’re working together, you’re entitled to receive [referral offer], to give to a family member or friend that you think is the same as you. It’s a gift I can give to you that you can pass on to someone you know would benefit from it.”
		
						
 
BONUS 1: GETTING PAST THE GATEKEEPER
						
Put yourself in the shoes of a gatekeeper. How many people do you think they go through in a day trying to get to their boss? They often feel empowered to be protective of the person that they are the gatekeeper to.
						
Treat them like the decision maker. They are often treated poorly and will feel the need to raise themselves up and look down on you because they have the power to do that. Treating them like the decision maker creates a sense of importance.
						
Gatekeeper Script Template:
						
“Hi [Gatekeeper name], I wonder if you can help me for a minute?”
						
*pause and wait for them to engage*
						
Following this, ask something of them that is easy. E.g. give their boss a small gift to get their attention and ask the gatekeeper to put it on their desk.
						
Alternatively, make a third party connection. E.g. [3rd party connection name] to me to contact you.
						
BONUS 2: CHALLENGE STRATEGIES
						
In the world of old-school selling, this is called ‘overcoming objections’. In today’s world, where we don’t want to be salesy, there are no objections - just challenges. We need to take ownership of any challenge that comes up and understand that we are ultimately responsible.
						
● List the top 3-5 reasons customers do not want to purchase what you offer 					
● Find ways to reengineer the challenges so you are addressing them first, rather than need to overcome them when the customer brings them up.
						
Example:

 “[Prospect name], this really reminds me of a customer we have. They thought that starting [product/service] it would [challenge], but found out that the longer they waited to [invest/commit/purchase], it ended up [negative impact of waiting to purchase].”
						
								 			
●  The secrets to get past objection and rejection commonly associated with this stage
		
●  How to re-engineer challenges so you never have to deal with objections again				
●  How to embed challenge-prevention strategies throughout your presentation
 								
so they never come up again

	BONUS 3: SCHEDULE THE FOLLOW UP
 								
Don’t underestimate the power of a follow up. If you’ve done a sales process and/or sales presentation and someone has said ‘no’ or told you to let them think about always understand that the person is simply saying I’m not quite ready now, not never. People's circumstances change and their needs shift.
 								
The secret to follow ups is to never leave the interaction without a time, day, date and a reason to contact again.
 								
When is too much follow up? If you have to ask you may be following up too much. Understand the prospect’s situation. Usually a no means not yet and you just need to keep in contact over time.
